\interlinepenalties = 2 8000 8000
%%%%%An extension to \interlinepenalty that allows different penalties to be added
%%%%after each line. It takes a space separated list of numbers as value. If n is
%%%%positive interlinepenalties n i1... in specifies the penalty to be used after
%%%%each of the lines in a paragraph, with the last value being repeated as often
%%%%as needed if the paragraph has more then n lines.
%%%
%
\clubpenalties = 2 8000 600
%%\clubpenalties
%%%An extension of \clubpenalty with the same syntax as \interlinepenalties.
%%
\widowpenalties = 3 10000 9000 6000 
%%%An extension of \widowpenalty with the same syntax as \interlinepenalties (lines arecounted backwards from the last line in this case).
%%
\displaywidowpenalties = 2 8000 5000 
%%%An extension of \widowpenalty with the same syntax as \widowpenalties with lines counted backwards from each display math within a paragraph.
%
%%XeTeX supports one additional primitive penalty:
%
%\XeTeXlinebreakpenalty=0
%%The full documentation of which is Inter-character linebreak penalty I believe it is the penalty inserted between characters for Asian typesetting which typically doesn't use inter-word spaces.
%
%%Other penalties are inserted by the format for example LaTeX defines a count
%
%\newcount\interfootnotelinepenalty \interfootnotelinepenalty=100
%%but locally arranges that \linepenalty is set to this value while setting footnotes.
%
%%Similarly article class sets
%
%\@lowpenalty   51
%\@medpenalty  151
%\@highpenalty 301
%%which are the values used by \pagebreak[1] ...
%
%%\samepage works by setting many of these penalties to "infinite" values:
%
%\def\samepage{\interlinepenalty\@M
%   \postdisplaypenalty\@M
%   \interdisplaylinepenalty\@M
%   \@beginparpenalty\@M
%   \@endparpenalty\@M
%   \@itempenalty\@M
%   \@secpenalty\@M
%   \interfootnotelinepenalty\@M}
%%Note penalties are not just numeric values they are actual nodes that are
%%inserted into the horizontal or vertical list. they can be inspected with
%%\lastpenalty or removed (in some contexts) with \unpenalty so for example
%%\count0=\lastpenalty will put the value of the penalty (even if it was
%%automatically inserted) into the count register if the penalty s the last thing
%%in the current horizontal or vertical list.
%
%%For example this bit of LaTeX which tries to insert italic corrections without disturbing the penalties in the horizontal list
%
%\def \fix@penalty {%
%  \ifnum \lastpenalty=\z@
%    \@@italiccorr
%  \else
%    \count@ \lastpenalty
%    \unpenalty
%    \@@italiccorr
%    \penalty \count@
%  \fi
%}
%This is part of all the commands such as \textit that try to insert automatic italic correction.

%Demerits

%The statement above that TeX tries to minimise penalties is in fact a
%simplification. For line breaking, the actual quantity that is minimised is
%demerits which is (more or less) the sum of the squares of the penalties
%associated with the linebreaks in a paragraph and the badness of each line
%(which is a measure of how much white space has been stretched beyond its
%specified limits) plus three additional demerit parameters as described below.
%The exact formula is in the TeXBook, but isn't usually relevant.

%The three demerit parameters and the default values given to them by LaTeX are:

%\doublehyphendemerits=10000
%Additional demerit added to the paragraph for each pair of consecutive lines ending in a discretionary (typically a hyphen).

%\finalhyphendemerits=5000
%Additional demerit added if the penultimate line ends with a discretionary.

%\adjdemerits=10000
%Additional demerit added for pairs of "incompatible" lines (ie a tight line in
%which white space is squeezed next to a loose line in which white space is
%stretched.)

%Note, the values of demerit parameters are typically large (they combine with
%the square of penalty and badness units) also demerits are just a value used in
%the line breaking calculation. Unlike penalties they do not correspond to nodes
%that may be manipulated in TeX lists.
